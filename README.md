    - type - NPC or PC
    - difficulty - null if PC, 0-10 for NPC
    - move_speed - how fast a Player's position can move to keep up with racket target point
    - current_X_percent - current virtual X of the Player, representing a percent
  - swing_racket 
    - plays swing animation
    - plays swing sound
    - calls hit_check
  - hit_check
    - checks if birdie is hit by racket
    - on hit, calls birdie_hit
    - on miss, calls birdie_miss
  - birdie_hit
    - plays hit sound
    - calculate birdie hit area of racket (rim or center)
    - calculates birdie trajectory
    - calls birdie_animate
  - birdie_miss
    - random trigger opponent.trash_talk
    - call opponent.score_increase
  - birdie_animate
    - animates birdie as it flies between player and AI, or vice versa
  - score_increase
    - increase the player's score by 1
  - trash_talk
    - randomly plays one trash talk sound appropriate to currently represented player

      - swing left
      - swing right

    - if NPC, will play in distance
    - if PC, will play in foreground
  - move
    - moves object's base representation left or right to be within arm_length of mouse.
    - animation happens over time, so player / NPC could be out of position to hit a shot
- AI inherits from Player:
  - choose_action
    - will choose appropriate action depending on relative position between object screen representation and birdie representation
    - will adjust hit "area" based on difficulty setting.  Higher difficulty will have a smaller margin of error
    - will trigger animation required to achieve desired outcome
